"We must always change, renew, rejuvenate ourselves; otherwise, we harden." 
—— Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

Hi, my friend, welcome to my site!

I’m Xujun, originally from a small but beautiful village in Anhui province, eastern China. As I grew older, I discovered there are more modes of transport than just cars—high-speed trains and airplanes connect our vast world, where different regions speak various languages. I gravitated to this intriguing planet and yearned to explore it. Through dedication and perseverance, I pursued higher education, earning a bachelor's degree from [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/)  and a doctoral degree from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn). Currently, I am conducting my postdoctoral research at [Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI)](https://www.psi.ch/en) in Switzerland. This academic journey has opened doors for me to visit fascinating places, meet extraordinary people, and engage in meaningful endeavours. It's truly a blessing!

My current research primarily focuses on hydrogen production, heat and mass transfer in multiphase flow, and waste treatment. Just reach out to me if you'd like to discuss these topics further.

You can find my CV here: [Xujun's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
