Supercritical water gasification technology provides a favorable technology to achieve pollution elimination and resource utilization of phenolic wastewater. In this study, the reaction mechanism of phenolic wastewater supercritical water gasification was investigated using a combination of experimental and computational methods. Five reaction channels were identified to elucidate the underlying pathway of phenol decomposition. Importantly, the rate-determining step was found to be the dearomatization reaction. By integrating computational and experimental analyses, it was found that phenol decomposition via the path with the lowest energy barrier generates cyclopentadiene, featuring a dearomatization barrier of 70.97 kcal/mol. Additionally, supercritical water plays a catalytic role in the dearomatization process by facilitating proton transfer. Based on the obtained reaction pathway, alkali salts (Na2CO3 and K2CO3) are employed as a catalyst to diminish the energy barrier of the rate-determining step to 40.00 kcal/mol and 37.14 kcal/mol. Alkali salts catalysis significantly improved carbon conversion and pollutant removal from phenolic wastewater, increasing CGE from 58.44% to 93.55% and COD removal efficiency from 94.11% to 99.79%. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the decomposition mechanism of phenolic wastewater in supercritical water.
