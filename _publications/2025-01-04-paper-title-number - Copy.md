The micro/nanoscale structures on metal surfaces are of significant research interest for boiling heat transfer and exhibit great application potential in the thermal management of high-power electronic devices. This study employs the molecular dynamics simulation method to investigate the boiling heat transfer characteristics of hydrophilic rectangular shallow nano-groove structures, comparing them with the smooth surface. The phase transition heat transfer characteristics of liquid films on the smooth surface, single rectangular groove (SRG) surface, and overlapping rectangular groove (ORG) surface are revealed by analyzing the variations of parameters such as energy contour diagrams, bubble volume, liquid film temperature, and average potential energy. The research results indicate that water molecules are in a solid-like state within shallow grooves, while the nucleation sites of initial bubbles form randomly outside the grooves. During the initial heating and bubble growth, the initial nucleation time and bubble growth rate of ORG are slower than those of SRG, due to the small rectangular groove on ORG that diminishes the energy transfer efficiency. During bubble formation and growth, the average kinetic energy within the liquid film fluctuates at the nucleation moment in the critical nucleation region, and the average potential energy rises from −0.083 eV. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the micro/nanoscale structure design of vapor–liquid phase transition thermal management devices.
